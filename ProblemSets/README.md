The solutions for these non-graded optional problem sets were made by me. I do not own the problem sets themselves nor do I claim commercial ownership for the code in these solutions. This collection of solutions are solely for educational purposes.

## About
These solutions are a way to assist my friends in understanding how to approach, design, and solve programming problems. That said, the code in these solutions are not the only ways to solve the problem sets.
