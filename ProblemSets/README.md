The solutions for these non-graded optional problem sets are my own designs.

# About
Because some of my friends wanted to improve their problem-solving and comprehension skills for programming, I have decided to use these solutions as a way to assist them in understanding how to approach, design, and solve said problems. That said, the code in these solutions are not the only ways to solve the problem sets.
